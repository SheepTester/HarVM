# its own setter like `batch storeBlock`
@if control if "$(a)" = 2 "batch $(if)" "batch $(else)"
	# `batch` is indentation sensitive. If the next line is more indented than the
	# previous, it'll use that as the baseline indent. All the following lines will
	# be deindented when stored in the variable.
	data log "a is equal to 2, epic"
@else
	# I think for situations where there are multiple blocks in a row, it'll group
	# the store commands before the actual command. Hmm
	data log "a is not equal to 2...?"

@str data log "$(str)"
